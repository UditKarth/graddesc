# Gradient Descent for 225
**Algorithm Summary:**

Gradient Descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm employed to find the local minimum of a function. In the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence, it's particularly used to minimize the cost function, which represents the difference between the predicted values and actual values. The basic idea of the algorithm is to tweak parameters iteratively in the direction of the steepest descent, or the negative gradient. The magnitude of the adjustments is determined by the learning rate, a hyperparameter that needs to be set prior to the commencement of the algorithm. In essence, starting from an initial set of parameters, the algorithm adjusts these parameters step-by-step to minimize the cost function until a convergence or a certain number of iterations is achieved.

**Function I/O:**

1. **Function Name:** `initialize_parameters`
    - **Inputs:** None
    - **Outputs:** Initial parameters (usually initialized to small random numbers or zeros).
    - **Test for Correctness:** Check that the parameters are initialized within the expected range.
  
2. **Function Name:** `compute_cost`
    - **Inputs:** Data points, parameters, target values.
    - **Outputs:** The computed cost for the given parameters.
    - **Test for Correctness:** With known data points and parameters, the function should return a predictable cost.
  
3. **Function Name:** `compute_gradient`
    - **Inputs:** Data points, parameters, target values.
    - **Outputs:** The gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter.
    - **Test for Correctness:** For certain scenarios (e.g., parameters set to zero), the gradient should have expected values.
  
4. **Function Name:** `update_parameters`
    - **Inputs:** Current parameters, computed gradient, learning rate.
    - **Outputs:** Updated parameters.
    - **Test for Correctness:** The updated parameters should move in the opposite direction of the gradient by an amount proportional to the learning rate.
  
5. **Function Name:** `gradient_descent`
    - **Inputs:** Data points, target values, initial parameters, learning rate, maximum number of iterations, and a convergence threshold.
    - **Outputs:** Optimized parameters.
    - **Test for Correctness:** For a well-known dataset, the function should converge to a known set of parameters or achieve a cost below a certain threshold.

In the process of testing, we'll use both synthetic datasets (where we know the underlying parameters) and real-world datasets. The synthetic datasets help in validating the correctness of the algorithm, as we can compare the learned parameters with the true ones. On the other hand, with real-world datasets, we aim to ensure that the cost function reaches a value that is comparable to benchmarked results or improves upon them.
